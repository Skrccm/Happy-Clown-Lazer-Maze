The laser follows the rules outlined by the Law of Reflection. The normal is used when predicting light angles. 
The incident ray (light coming towards mirror) is equal to the reflection ray (light going away from mirror). In this case,
the incident ray is always 45 degrees. 
The laser may only move through empty spaces. Spaces with a mirror facing an appropriate direction will cause the laser
to reflect. Otherwise, if the space contains a block or a mirror facing a wrong direction, the laser will stop.
