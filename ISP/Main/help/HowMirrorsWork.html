When a laser approaches a mirror, the mirror has two possible ways to reflect the laser.
It is different for each laser direction. For example, a laser headed east can be reflected up or down by a mirror facing north-west or south-west.
The reflective side of the mirror is indicated clearly by a white line. The side with the white line is the reflective side.
Lasers can only be reflected on this side.
