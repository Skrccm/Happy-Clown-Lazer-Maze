Press F1 for more instructions.
<br>
<br>
The object of the game is to get the laser that comes out of the emittor to hit the collector using mirrors to reflect the laser.
Score is based on the time taken to complete the level.
<br>
<br>
To shoot the laser, press the go button. Press it again to stop the laser.
<br>
<br>
To complete the level, the laser that is shot from the emittor after pressing the go button must travel to the collector. If you manage to do so, it will automatically bring you to the level complete screen.
<br>
<br>
Mirrors are the only objects on the grid that you may move. You can click on them to rotate them 45 degrees clockwise.
<br>
<br>
When a laser approaches a mirror, the mirror has two possible ways to reflect the laser.
It is different for each laser direction. For example, a laser headed east can be reflected up or down by a mirror facing north-west or south-west.
The reflective side of the mirror is indicated clearly by a white line. The side with the white line is the reflective side.
Lasers can only be reflected on this side.
